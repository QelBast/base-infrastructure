# Qelb infrastructure

My infra on Proxmox + k8s using Packer, Terraform, ArgoCD and other interesting tools

The project was born out of my idea to deploy a local production-level infrastructure.
Basic principles of development:

* Security;
* OSS stack (or at least with free commercial use);
* Without a lot of shitcode;
* Deployment in several primitive actions on the part of the user;

This is the meta repository of the project.
If you're looking for subsidiaries, here's a list of them.:

* Node VM packing - <https://github.com/QelBast/packer-k8s-node-builders>;
